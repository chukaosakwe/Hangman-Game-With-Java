# Hangman-Game-With-Java
Hangman Game Built Using Java

Hangman is a 2-player word-guessing game generally played by having one player think of a word and the other player trying to guess that word letter by letter.

This is a computer vs user version of the game. The computer picks a random word from an input dictionary file.

I have coded 2 versions of the game:

version 1 is the traditional hangman game: In the traditional version of the game, the computer has to stick to the original
word as the user guesses

version 2: In the evil version, the computer keeps changing the word in order
to make the userâ€™s task harder.

The computer randomly picks a version of the game and this is unknown to the user until the game is over

Results and progress of the game is displayed using text on the screen
